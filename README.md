## ⚙️ Expression Engine

fx uses a **custom mathematical expression parser** written in JavaScript instead of `eval()`.

The parser supports:

* Operator precedence
* Arithmetic operators
* Unary operators
* Powers
* Postfix operators
* Parentheses
* Mathematical functions
* Constants
* Variables
* Implicit multiplication

### Examples

```text
2 + 3 × 4
2(3 + 4)
2π
sin(30)
√(25)
2^3
5!
x^2 + 2x + 1
```

The calculator also automatically balances missing closing parentheses while rejecting invalid expressions and unsupported characters.
